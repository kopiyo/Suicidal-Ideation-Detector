# Suicidal-Ideation-Detector
A web-based machine learning application that analyzes user-provided text to identify potential suicidal ideas using natural language processing techniques. This is important for early detection and prevention efforts, thus minimizing suicide related death cases.

The figure above shows the main interface of the Suicidal Tweet Detector web application. The application provides a text input area where users can enter tweet content for analysis. The system is built using a machine learning model based on LSTM architecture to analyze the emotional tone of the input text and identify potential suicidal ideation and classifies whether a tweet is negative or positive. The simple and user-friendly design allows for easy interaction and quick analysis.

This figure above illustrates an example output generated by the Suicidal Tweet Detector after analyzing a user-provided tweet. The system displays the predicted classification as Non-Suicidal / Positive, along with a confidence score that reflects the model’s prediction certainty. Additionally, the response time is shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the web-based machine learning system in providing real-time analysis.
